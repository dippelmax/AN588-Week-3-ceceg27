This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Homework 2

#challenge 1
#ppois is used to find the probability of something equal to or less than, and can be switched to equal to or more with the command lower = false
```{r}
ppois(8, lambda = 15, lower = FALSE)

### I got the same answer
```
#challenge 2
#you can use ppois or dpois here and get the same answer because nothing is less than 0
```{r}
ppois(0, lambda = 15)

### I got the same answer
```

#challenge 3
#dpois calculates the probability of one random variable in a given range
```{r}
dpois(3, lambda = 15)

### I got the same answer
```

#challenge 4 
#using code from module 8 here and changing the x and l values
```{r}
x <- 0:30
l = 15
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = "Probability Mass Function", col = "darkblue")

### Nice color on the graph, looks good content wise also
```

#challenge 5
#rpois can be used to generate numbers for a given poisons distribution
```{r}
set.seed(2)

monkeys <- data.frame('data' = rpois(104, 15))

hist(monkeys$data,
main="Histogram for 104 simulated saturdays",
xlab="x",
ylab = "Pr(X = x)",
xlim=c(0,30),
col="darkmagenta",
freq=FALSE
)

### looks great. Really smart with the data.frame and rpois. I couldn't figure it out and my graph looks really strange. Graph also looks great with label, a title and color. 

```
#the simulated histogram is much more centered around the mean and less evenly distirbuted than the probability mass function, though it generally takes on a similar shape. I assume it would come to resemble the PMF as n increased.
